# pp Display

This is a tool that uses the osu! API to gather data surrounding your top plays, as well as your most recent play
This data will eventually be displayed locally, and through a display using a rasberry pi!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/will-smithgall/ppDisplay
```
2. Install the requirements 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Create a file called ```.env```. Inside this file, have two lines for your API client ID and Secret
It should look this once complete
```sh
CLIENT_ID=xxxxx
CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
